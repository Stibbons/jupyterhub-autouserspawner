# JupyterHub Auto Spawner

A very simple [Spawner](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub/wiki/Spawners) for
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub) that spawns local processes.

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION USE CASES!** It is incredibly insecure, and
offers no user isolation *at all*. This is intended only for testing purposes.

## What? ##

It spawns new notebooks for users, but as the same user as jupyterhub. This
has the following advantages:
    1. No need to run JupyterHub as root
    2. Users don't need to exist in the system.

However, it offers absolutely *no* isolation whatsoever, so users can very
easily mess with each others' processes. So do not use this in a production
environment of any sort.

## Installation ##

You can install it from pip via:

```
pip install jupyterhub-simplespawner
```

You can set JupyterHub to use this spawner with the following line in your
`jupyter_config.py`:

```
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'autouserspawner.AutoUserLocalProcessSpawner'
```

## Configuration ##

You can configure where the users have their homes with the `home_path_template`
config parameter. You can use `{userid}` and `{username}` in the template and
they will be expanded to appropriate values.

## Use with... ##

This can be used to good effect with the [DummyAuthenticator](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-dummy-authenticator)
to provide simple testing environments.
